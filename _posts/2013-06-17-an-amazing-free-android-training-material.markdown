A very small company, Free Electrons, based in France is doing an amazing job at supporting companies and organizations using embedded Linux in their embedded projects.
Their are so committed to free software they even release their training materials. They have a brilliant Android training, which cover every layer of Android (kernel, compilation, libs, IPC, etc).

I can only suggest you to have a look:
