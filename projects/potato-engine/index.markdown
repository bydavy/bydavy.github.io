![](http://code.google.com/p/potatoengine/logo?cct=1290269515)**What is Potato Engine ?**

The Potato Engine is a set of libraries and tools designed to speed up cross-platform game development on the PC (Linux/Windows). I was enrolled in this project during my studies. We deal with a lot of computer science field, from computer graphics to networks.

Every work done for this project is under various open source licenses (GPL/LGPL) and can be very useful for a beginner in game development.

**Where can I find it ?**

It's simple here : [http://code.google.com/p/potatoengine/](http://code.google.com/p/potatoengine/)

**I'm not sure to understand what it's for ...**

Sometime a small video is better than text, so here we are.

This video is a demonstration of the network prototype realised in mid-2010 -ogre3D, ODE and C++-.  
Approximately 2 weeks of works -design + code- outside of the student life =0)
