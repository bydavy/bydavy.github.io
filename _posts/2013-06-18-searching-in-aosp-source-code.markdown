Sometimes, you needÂ to dig in Android frameworks to figure how to use or optimize some portion of your code. As a good developer you probably have the master branch of AOSP pulled locally on your machine, but if that's not the case I suggest you to checkout [AndroidXRef](http://androidxref.com/). They provide search across AOSP source code and cross-reference (almost like browsing the code from your favorite IDE).[
