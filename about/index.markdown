**Who are you ?**

My name is Davy Leggieri. I'm curious, open minded and passionate by IT. I am lucky, my job is my passion. I'm also into photography but this blog is dedicated to my first passion.

**Why IT ?**

I love the challenge, and IT is full of challenges. As every human, I also like create starting from nothing. See a project growing up, making a team with the same vision of the futur, collecting user feedbacks, rethinking our world... Today IT is more than technologies, is about us, humans.
