**What is this ?**

This is a research project that I conduct for my last review project as student. My tutor is Steeve Maddock, head of theÂ Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality Research Group at the University of Sheffield in England.

**The aim**

A lot of works exist for simulate crowd but less about the interface to author crowd animation. This project explore a sketch interface solution.

**Something to show ?**

I have a demonstration made at the end of the internship.
