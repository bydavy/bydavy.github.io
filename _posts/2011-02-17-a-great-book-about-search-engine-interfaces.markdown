I read a great online book about search engine interface: "Search engine user interfaces" by Marti A.

What I like is that the book is FREE, isn't technic but gives you a new approach to interfaces (by interfaces, I mean every kind of interface: softwares, websites). You will discover some guidelines like "offer efficient and informative feedback". Sometime, they seem very simple but they are very effective. The chapter dedicated to guidelines is the chapter 1, here is a quick overview :
	
  * Keeping the interface simple
  * ...
  * Offer efficient and informative feedback
  * Balance user control with automated actions
  * Reduce short-term memory usage
  * Provide shortcuts
  * Reduce errors
  * Recognize the importance of small details
  * Recognize the importance of aesthetic in design
