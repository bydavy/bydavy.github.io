**What is Card Receipts ?**

Card receipts is an application for Android that manages your credit/debit card receipts. No more hours spent to match your receipts with your bank account. This application will keep an updated, easy to browse and search list of receipts.

**Where can I find it ?**

Unfortunately, It's still in WIP and not available in Google Play yet. But you can checkout the code: [http://github.com/bydavy/Card-Receipts](http://github.com/bydavy/Card-Receipts)

(I work on a private repository and will publish only milestones to github)

(This application is still in work and screens are not final)
