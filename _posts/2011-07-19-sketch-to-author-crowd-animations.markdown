My last year internship was a research project about crowd simulation. The idea was to not focus on simulation but on user control over the crowd. Some research has explored user control techniques that involve using a ‘brush tool’ (similar to a paint brush) or pre-labelling areas of the environment or using a sketch-based approach. 

The solution developed is a sketch-based interface to author crowd animation. A user can sketch the boundaries of crowd formations and the crowd moves from one formation to another.

The next step will be to introduce more patterns to fill the formation and add a path to follow in-between formations.
